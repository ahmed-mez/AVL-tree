# C implementation of AVL Tree
The implementation covers all needed functions to manipulate the AVL tree.
### How to build
To build, run `make` at the command line in the current directory.
By default, this will generate an executable called `avl`.
### Example
An example of constructed *AVL tree* in the `main` function in `AVL_tree.c`.
